A basic video player.

Goals:
 - Audio and video decoding through libav
 - No tearing, buffering, or other annoying behaviour

Architecture:
 - Frames will be processed through the chain as and when the renderer requests
   them. i.e. it will be pull-based.
 - Source -> Demuxer -> Stream -> Decoder -> Filter -> Renderer
                     -> Stream -> Decoder -> Renderer
                        ...
                     -> Stream -> Decoder -> Renderer
 - The Demuxer will read the Source and place packets into the Streams until
   there are no Streams that require further data.
